As a real estate investor, diversifying your portfolio often involves considering various asset classes, and Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) can be an enticing proposition. When venturing into Real Estate Investments one must consider to evaluate the option of investing into the Real Estate Sector through the NCD route and furthermore , you should preferably opt for listed debentures over unlisted ones. When you invest into listed real estate debt, not only does a Debenture Trustee act as your financial guardian in this space, but listed debentures also bring an added layer of protection through SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) guidelines.

The RBI's steadfast monetary policy, keeping the repo rate at 6.5%, indicates a strategic balancing act between curbing inflation and bolstering economic growth. With the inflation target yet to meet the 4% benchmark, the RBI, under Governor Shaktikanta Das, leans towards a cautious yet growth-oriented policy. The RBI's growth forecast for India at an optimistic 7% points to a confidence in domestic economic resilience, outpacing international projections. Alongside maintaining economic stability, the RBI has made strategic enhancements to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), raising the transaction cap to Rs 5 lakhs for payments to hospitals and educational institutions, and up to Rs 1 lakh for recurring transactions such as credit card bills, mutual fund subscriptions, and insurance premiums. These increases are set to bolster high-value payment convenience through UPI, with an additional authentication layer for transactions exceeding Rs 1 lakh, thereby supporting larger ecosystem sectors and advancing digital payment adoption.
