# Beacon Homepage Design Aesthetic (Swiss UI)

## Overall Direction
The homepage follows a Swiss UI direction: precise grid structure, disciplined typography, high contrast hierarchy, and editorial rhythm. Layouts are deliberate, modular, and dense without feeling crowded. The aesthetic signals institutional credibility with a modern, minimal, high‑rigor tone.

## Core Principles
- Grid‑first composition: visible/implicit grid lines, strong column logic, consistent gutters.
- Typographic rigor: oversized headings, tight tracking, uppercase labels, confident scale jumps.
- High contrast structure: dark navy + white foundations with gold accents for hierarchy.
- Editorial pacing: large blocks of negative space, structured section headers, and sharp dividers.
- Functional minimalism: limited decoration, purposeful imagery, and restrained motion.

## Visual Language
- **Palette**: Navy (`#0B1230`) as primary base, white as field, gold (`#D6B26E`) as accent. Secondary slate tones used sparingly for body text.
- **Type**: Serif for headings (classic, authoritative) and sans for UI/labels (precise, modern).
- **Grid**: 12‑column structure, visible swiss grid overlays and border divisions.
- **Shapes**: Sharp rectangles, minimal radius, aligned edges; no soft or playful geometry.
- **Imagery**: Editorial, monochrome/low‑saturation, with overlays; used as structure not decoration.

## Section‑by‑Section Notes
- **Hero**: Monumental type, uppercase labels, heavy contrast, dense data strip, strict center alignment. Background image is subdued via opacity + gradient for institutional mood.
- **About / Values / Process**: Split‑column editorial layout, sticky headers, strong typographic hierarchy, and grid‑based cards with strict borders.
- **Services / Media / Testimonials**: Dark‑theme blocks with gold accents, precise card grids, high‑contrast overlays, and disciplined motion.
- **Pricing**: Swiss poster style—blocky, uppercase headings, grid cards with tight typographic hierarchy.
- **CTA / Footer**: Simple color fields with large type; minimal form elements; emphasis on clarity and conversion.

## Motion & Interaction
- AOS‑style fades and short transitions are used to reveal hierarchy.
- Hover states emphasize contrast (gold/white inversion, border animations).
- Motion is restrained; focus stays on structure and content weight.

## Design Intent Summary
The homepage is a modern institutional Swiss system: rigid grid, authoritative typography, bold editorial scale, and selective gold accents. It reads as trustworthy, methodical, and premium—more like a financial prospectus than a startup landing page.
