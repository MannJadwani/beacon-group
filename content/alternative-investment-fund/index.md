## What is a Trust?

**A trust is a relationship in which:**  
  
A person or entity (the Trustee) holds legal title to certain property (the Trust Property) but is bound by a fiduciary duty to exercise that legal control for the benefit of one or more individuals or organizations (the Beneficiary), who hold ‘beneficial’ title. Such beneficiaries may be limited to the family members under a family trust / private trust. A trust is usually governed by the terms of the executed trust instrument (the Trust Deed) and the applicable law of the land. The entity (one or more individuals, a partnership, or a corporation) that creates a trust is called the Grantor/Settlor.

### Private trusts can be classified based on various factors:

* Revocable Trust vs. Irrevocable Trust: Revocable trusts can be altered or terminated, while irrevocable trusts cannot.
* Discretionary Trust vs. Specific Trust: Discretionary trusts grant the trustee discretion in distributing income/assets, while specific trusts have fixed beneficiaries.

### Benefits a Private TrustBenefit to Investment Manager

* In the Event of a Personal Dispute assets of the trusts are not attached
* The Tax Structure of the Trust is most Beneficial as compared to individual
* Succession Planning works well under Tax Structure as Compared to nominating individual as a Nominee.

![](https://beacontrustee.co.in/assets/images/family_t.JPG)

### The key responsibilities of a trustee in a Private trust include-

* **Administration:** The corporate trustee handles the day-to-day administrative tasks of the trust, such as record-keeping,
  asset management, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
* **Fiduciary duty:** The corporate trustee has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, ensuring that the trust’s assets are managed prudently and in accordance with the trust’s terms
* **Distribution of income and assets:**The corporate trustee is responsible for distributing income and assets from the trust to the beneficiaries according tothe terms of the trust document. They ensure that distributions are made in a fair and equitable manner.
* **Objective decision-making:**As a neutral third party, a corporate trustee can make impartial decisions, avoiding conflicts of interest that may arise when family members serve as trustees.

### Role of Corporate Trustee in Private Trust

* The role of a corporate trustee in a private trust is to act as a professional entity responsible for managing and administering the trust on behalf of the beneficiaries. **It is advisable to opt for corporate trustee for family trust as it provide benefits of corporate with long term sustainability and corporate governance.** When selecting a corporate trustee, consider factors such as their reputation, financial stability, range of services offered, fee structure, and communication and responsiveness.

As a real estate investor, diversifying your portfolio often involves considering various asset classes, and Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) can be an enticing proposition. When venturing into Real Estate Investments one must consider to evaluate the option of investing into the Real Estate Sector through the NCD route and furthermore , you should preferably opt for listed debentures over unlisted ones. When you invest into listed real estate debt, not only does a Debenture Trustee act as your financial guardian in this space, but listed debentures also bring an added layer of protection through SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) guidelines.

The RBI's steadfast monetary policy, keeping the repo rate at 6.5%, indicates a strategic balancing act between curbing inflation and bolstering economic growth. With the inflation target yet to meet the 4% benchmark, the RBI, under Governor Shaktikanta Das, leans towards a cautious yet growth-oriented policy. The RBI's growth forecast for India at an optimistic 7% points to a confidence in domestic economic resilience, outpacing international projections. Alongside maintaining economic stability, the RBI has made strategic enhancements to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), raising the transaction cap to Rs 5 lakhs for payments to hospitals and educational institutions, and up to Rs 1 lakh for recurring transactions such as credit card bills, mutual fund subscriptions, and insurance premiums. These increases are set to bolster high-value payment convenience through UPI, with an additional authentication layer for transactions exceeding Rs 1 lakh, thereby supporting larger ecosystem sectors and advancing digital payment adoption.
